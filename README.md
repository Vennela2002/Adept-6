# Adept-6
Introduction
In today's fast-evolving technological landscape, the fusion of design and fabrication is crucial in shaping the future of robotics. With the growing demand for versatile and efficient robots, understanding the intricate details of design principles and fabrication techniques becomes essential. The Adept-6, a tabletop-sized robot, plays a key role in industrial automation, research and development, educational robotics, and small-scale manufacturing. This design analysis report seeks to assess the structural integrity of the robot.

Methodology
The design analysis was carried out using Autodesk Fusion 360, a computer-aided design (CAD) software. We redesigned the Adept-6 robot to fit tabletop dimensions while preserving the core functionality and aesthetics of the original design.

To form our opinion and perform the necessary design calculations for the robot model, the following phases were completed:

Reference Gathering: We compiled visual references regarding the gripper’s structure, dimensions, and overall appearance.

Modeling Approach: Utilizing Fusion 360’s advanced modeling tools, we developed the basic geometric shapes that constitute the robot, including the base, arm segments, and grippers.

Dimensional Scaling: The design was adapted to a tabletop size by adjusting the base diameter to 120 mm while maintaining proportional relationships at a 0.6x scale factor throughout the design.

Assembly and Validation: After modeling individual components, they were assembled to form the complete gripper robot. The design was continuously validated to ensure dimensional accuracy and functionality.

Conclusion
The design and development of a versatile, low-cost Adept-6 model were made possible through a systematic approach. Using Fusion 360, a 3D CAD software, the robot was designed and structurally analyzed.

This model is suitable for industrial applications such as packaging and assembly. The structural analysis confirmed that the design meets the required specifications and can handle various payloads, making it ideal for use in hazardous environments. Additionally, it is expected to significantly enhance productivity in industrial settings. Future simulations can be conducted within the specified workspace to further optimize its performance.
